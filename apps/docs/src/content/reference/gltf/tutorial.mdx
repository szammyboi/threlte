This tutorial will cover all things @threlte/gltf from loading models, to using their animations, and even more advanced features such as compression.

<Tip type="info">
  You should be well versed in Svelte, Three.js, and Threlte before using @threlte/gltf. If you are unsure
  about Svelte, consult its [Tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial) for a quick introduction. As for
  Threejs, make sure you at least glance over its [official documentation](https://threejs.org). 
  For the basics on Threlte, you can consult the [learning section of this website](/docs/learn/getting-started/introduction).
</Tip>

## Storing Models


The models in this project will be stored in the public folder that comes with Svelte so that they can easily be accessed and loaded.
The first model we will use is [Battle Damaged Sci-fi Helmet](https://skfb.ly/QNwv) by [theblueturtle_](https://sketchfab.com/theblueturtle_)


## Initial App Structure

The initial app structure for this tutorial includes a simple scene setup and some cameras to frame the 3D model correctly. The model will be created in a separate <i>Model.svelte</i> file.

```svelte title="App.svelte"
<script>
  import { Canvas } from '@threlte/core'
  import Scene from './Scene.svelte'
</script>

<Canvas>
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

```svelte title="Scene.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { OrbitControls } from '@threlte/extras'
  import Model from './Model.svelte'

</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  position={[5, 2, 5]}
  fov={25}
>
  <OrbitControls
    autoRotate
    enableDamping
  />
</T.PerspectiveCamera>

<T.AmbientLight />
<T.DirectionalLight position={[5, 10, 5]} />

<Model />
```

## GLTF Tag

The simplest way to get started with 3D models in Threlte is with the GLTF tag. This tag loads the 3D model specified in the URL attribute in its entirety into one object. However, models loaded in this method cannot be efficiently re-used.

```svelte title="Model.svelte" {1-9}+
<script lang="ts">
    import { T } from '@threlte/core'
    import { GLTF } from '@threlte/extras'

</script>

<GLTF url="/models/helmet/DamagedHelmet.gltf" />
```

<Example
  path="gltf/step-1"
  hideCode
/>


## Hooks
useGltf is a Svelte hook that allows the different nodes and materials of a model to be loaded and used separately.
These loaded nodes and materials can be re-used across multiple models and altered freely.

The current example of loading the entire model can also be switched over to the useGltf hook rather easily. 

```svelte title="Model.svelte" {3}m {8}- {5,10-12}+
<script lang="ts">
    import { T } from '@threlte/core'
    import { useGltf } from '@threlte/extras' // m

    const gltf = useGltf('/models/helmet/DamagedHelmet.gltf')
</script>

<GLTF url="/models/helmet/DamagedHelmet.gltf" />

{#if $gltf}
  <T is={$gltf.nodes['node_damagedHelmet_-6514']} />
{/if}
```

<Example
  path="gltf/step-2"
  hideCode
/>

The individual nodes and materials of a model can be accessed through the hook.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { useGltf } from '@threlte/extras'
  const gltf = useGltf('/models/helmet/DamagedHelmet.gltf')
  $: nodes: $gltf?.nodes
  $: materials: $gltf?.materials
</script>
```

This allows you to control the pieces of the model that you use. For example, you can use the geometry
of a model without using any of the materials.

<Example
  path="gltf/step-3"
/>

## Compression Algorithms

Threlte has built in support for using and generating compressed models
of GLTF file formats. Generating compressed models is detailed in the [command line
section](#command-line) at the end of this tutorial. We will focus in this section on 
loading and using compressed models, specifically with DRACO compression. Compression is very
important for large models and models with included animations <i>(hint, hint)</i>.

The model being used in this section is [Littlest Tokyo](https://artstation.com/artwork/1AGwX) by [Glen
  Fox](https://artstation.com/glenatron), CC Attribution.

With the complexity of this model, we are switching back to GLTF tag method of loading
models so that all the nodes are loaded automatically.

```svelte title="Scene.svelte" {10-11}m {12-13,18}+
<script lang="ts">
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { OrbitControls } from '@threlte/extras'
  import Model from './Model.svelte'

</script>

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  position={[600, 200, 600]}
  fov={45}
  near={10}
  far={10000}
>
  <OrbitControls
    autoRotate
    enableDamping
    target={[-60, -75, 0]}
  />
</T.PerspectiveCamera>

<T.AmbientLight />
<T.DirectionalLight position={[5, 10, 5]} />

<Model />
```

It's as simple as setting the useDraco option to true for your model.


```svelte title="Model.svelte" {3}m {5,8-10}- {12-15}+
<script lang="ts">
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { GLTF } from '@threlte/extras'

  const gltf = useGltf('/models/helmet/DamagedHelmet.gltf')
</script>

{#if $gltf}
    <T is={$gltf.nodes['node_damagedHelmet_-6514']} />
{/if}

<GLTF
  url="/models/LittlestTokyo.glb"
  useDraco={true}
/>
```

<Example
  path="gltf/step-4"
  hideCode
/>

This can also be done for the useGltf hook doing the following:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    const gltf = useGltf('/models/LittlestTokyo.gltf' {
        useDraco: true
    })
</script>
```

Or, with a custom decoder:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    const gltf = useGltf('/models/LittlestTokyo.gltf' {
        useDraco: "https://www.gstatic.com/draco/v1/decoders/"
    })
</script>
```

## Animations

Animations are accessed in Threlte with the useGltfAnimations hook. The hook can be used to load in single animations or all animations at once
by changing the desired animation in the type of the function. In this case, we are
accessing the 'Take 001' animation. It will load the animations of the model bound to the gltf
variable but it can also take a model as an argument.

```svelte title="Model.svelte" {3}m {5,7,11}+
<script lang="ts">
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { GLTF, useGltfAnimations } from '@threlte/extras'
  
  const { gltf, actions } = useGltfAnimations<'Take 001'>() 

  $: $actions['Take 001']?.play()
</script>

<GLTF
  bind:gltf={$gltf}
  url="/models/LittlestTokyo.glb"
  useDraco={true}
/>
```

<Example
  path="gltf/step-5"
  hideCode
/>

## Command Line

The @threlte/gltf api is very simple and concise, doing a lot of the work for you.
However, if you want to re-use a large model with many animations it becomes very cumbersome
to import all of the animations and nodes using the hooks. This is where the command line tool comes in.
It can take a GLTF model and automatically generate a <i>Model.svelte</i> file for you with every
piece of the model setup.

For example, the following command can be used for the LittlestTokyo model.

```bash
npx @threlte/gltf@latest LittlestTokyo.glb --transform
```

This will generate a massive model file like so:

```svelte

Title: Littlest Tokyo

<script>
  import { Group } from 'three'
  import { T, forwardEventHandlers } from '@threlte/core'
  import { useGltf, useGltfAnimations } from '@threlte/extras'

  export const ref = new Group()

  const gltf = useGltf('/LittlestTokyo-transformed.glb', { useDraco: true })
  export const { actions, mixer } = useGltfAnimations(gltf, ref)

  const component = forwardEventHandlers()
</script>

<T is={ref} dispose={false} {...$$restProps} bind:this={$component}>
  {#await gltf}
    <slot name="fallback" />
  {:then gltf}
    <T.Group name="OSG_Scene">
      <T.Group name="RootNode_(gltf_orientation_matrix)" rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}>
        <T.Group name="RootNode_(model_correction_matrix)">
          <T.Group name="4cd116fc63ca40809810ca0842dc78edfbx" rotation={[Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}>
            <T.Group>
              <T.Group name="RootNode">
                <T.Group>
                  <T.Group
                    name="Object078"
                    position={[76.07, 163.94, 118.6]}
                    rotation={[-Math.PI / 3, 0, 0]}
                    scale={3.1}
                  >
                    <T.Group position={[-97.41, -7.13, -96.27]}>
                      <T.Mesh
                        name="Object078_Plastic_Soft_0"
                        geometry={gltf.nodes.Object078_Plastic_Soft_0.geometry}
                        material={gltf.materials.Plastic_Soft}
                      />
                    </T.Group>

                    ...
```

This file can then be included in your scene like any other model, re-using geometry
and materials wherever it can.

```svelte
<Model position={[0, 0, 0]} />
<Model position={[10, 0, -10]} />
```
